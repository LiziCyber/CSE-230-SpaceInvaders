# CSE-230-SpaceInvaders
## Overview

### Project Title
**Space Invader**

### Description
Space Invader is our Haskell-based modernization of the classic arcade game, Space Invaders. Players battle descending aliens, moving horizontally at the bottom of the screen. Using the Brick library, our project aims to preserve the game's nostalgic essence while incorporating fresh, dynamic gameplay elements.

## Team Members
- Shanhe Ding
- Ziping Li
- Jiahao Li
- Zengmin Xiao

## Goals and Objectives
- Create an engaging and innovative arcade game using Haskell and the Brick library.
- Enrich the traditional Space Invaders gameplay with contemporary and dynamic features.
- Foster a collaborative environment, ensuring meaningful contributions from all team members.

## Project Proposal

### Concept
- A terminal-based adaptation of Space Invaders with augmented gameplay mechanics.
- Retain core elements of the classic game while introducing new, engaging features.

### Planned Features
- **Classic Game Mechanics**: Maintain the player-controlled shooter, strategic barriers, and a scoring system based on alien elimination.
- **Enhanced Player Movement**: Allow the player's shooter to move in all four directions, adding strategic depth.
- **Diverse Enemy Types**: Introduce a variety of enemies with unique behaviors and attack patterns.
- **Varied Ammunition**: Different bullet types for strategic gameplay.

### Additional Features
- **Local Leaderboard**: Track and display high scores.
- **Leveled Settings**: Adjustable difficulty settings and different levels.
- **Endless Mode**: Continuous gameplay mode for an unending challenge.

### Development Approach
- Utilize Haskell and the Brick library for robust and creative game development.
- Regular team meetings for consistent progress and collaborative problem-solving.
- GitHub for code sharing and version control.

### Milestones
- **11/17**: Proposal submission with detailed game concept and design.
- **12/1**: Implementation of basic game mechanics and player movement feature.
- **12/15**: Final game demonstration with all features.

## Expected Outcomes
- A unique, text-based version of Space Invaders with enhanced gameplay experience.
- Showcase of our ability to adapt a classic game within Haskell programming.
- Demonstration of teamwork, technical skills, and innovative problem-solving.
